# Module 3 - python challenge
This is my solution to the Module 3 Challenge as part of the UCI Data Analyst Bootcamp curriculum. 
This assignment is a good refresher for me on python file i/o and string formatting for outputs.
## To Run 
1. Navigate to the PyBank folder and run **main.py**
2. Navigate to the PyPoll folder and run **main.py**
```bash
    # Example on how to run main.py
    python main.py
```
## References
I referred to the Learning Assitant when I wanted to learn how to format the output to the terminal and text file.
